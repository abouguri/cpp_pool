# C++ Pool (cpp_pool)

This repository contains a collection of C++ exercises organized in modules of increasing complexity. Each module is designed to teach specific C++ concepts and programming techniques.

## Modules

- **CPP00**: Introduction to C++ - namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and other basic concepts
- **CPP01**: Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement
- **CPP02**: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form
- **CPP03**: Inheritance
- **CPP04**: Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces
- **CPP05**: Try/Catch and Exceptions
- **CPP06**: C++ casts
- **CPP07**: C++ templates
- **CPP08**: Templated containers, iterators, algorithms
- **CPP09**: STL

## How to Use This Repository

Each module directory (e.g., cpp00, cpp01, etc.) contains:
- A README.md with specific instructions for the exercises in that module
- Exercise directories (ex00, ex01, etc.) with source code files

To compile exercises, navigate to the exercise directory and use the provided Makefile:

```bash
cd cpp00/ex00
make
./executable_name
