# CPP00 - Introduction to C++

This module introduces the basic concepts of C++ programming. It focuses on namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static and const variables, and other basic C++ functionalities.

## Exercises

### Ex00: Megaphone
A simple program that transforms input strings to uppercase.
- Input: a series of strings
- Output: uppercase version of the input strings

### Ex01: My Awesome PhoneBook
A simple phonebook program using classes to store and display contact information.
- Features: adding contacts, searching contacts, displaying all contacts
- Implementation focuses on class structure and basic I/O operations

### Ex02: Job of Your Dreams
A program to recreate a specific output from a partial implementation. This exercise focuses on:
- Account class implementation
- Managing financial data
- Working with initialization lists
- Understanding static members
- Following specific output formatting

## Requirements

- Compile with C++98 standard: `-std=c++98`
- Use compiler flags: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`
- Follow the Orthodox Canonical Form when creating classes
- No memory leaks allowed
- All classes must have proper constructors and destructors

## Tips for Ex02

1. Study the provided Account.hpp header file carefully
2. Implement the missing Account.cpp file to match the expected output
3. Pay attention to the static members and their initialization
4. Follow the date format in the provided output
5. Ensure all financial calculations are accurate

## Testing

Each exercise comes with its own test files or expected output. Make sure your implementation matches the expected behavior exactly.
